[Profefe](https://github.com/profefe/profefe) is a project developed by
[@narqo](https://github.com/narqo). I was looking for a solution to do
continuous profiling and I realized his code was well abstracted and comfortable
to extend. The API server was already done and I decided to write an integration
with Kubernetes.

The current maintainer is [Gianluca aka @gianarb](https://github.com/gianarb).
