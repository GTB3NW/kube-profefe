[Profefe](https://github.com/profefe/profefe) is a project developed by
[@narqo](https://github.com/narqo). I was looking for a solution to do
continuous profiling and I realized his code was well abstracted and comfortable
to extend. The API server was already done and I decided to write an integration
with Kubernetes.

The documentation is located to [./docs/content/docs](./docs/content/docs) or to
[kubernetes.profefe.dev](https://kubernetes.profefe.dev).
